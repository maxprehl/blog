Some notes for now, will host somewhere eventually?

## Motivation

Hey y'all, and welcome!  Here's a quick bit on why this thing exists!

So I was troubleshooting my Debian WSL install and I had to go nuclear... \*BIG sigh\*  (The reason I had a Debian WSL install, along with Ubuntu, and several Hyper-V virtual machines, is another story in itself.)  But as I was scraping the internet once again for setting up Debian's apt repos _again_, I realized it was probably time for me to start taking notes on such things.  For selfish reasons for now, but perhaps useful to others later.

I was also browsing Maggie Appleton's [site](https://maggieappleton.com/) and [tweets](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1279798483218767877?s=20) and I fell in love with the idea of [Digital Gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).  Because honestly, internet black holes and countless hours of research are kinda my jam.

So here it is!  The beginnings!

## Status :warning:

For now I'll simply be using this repo to contain my notes (in Markdown form of course) and things I may want to reference later.

I'll try to keep this README updated with links while it's small, but obviously as things grow I'll need some more elaborate organization.

### Pages

[Debian Testing](./debian-testing.md)

## Contributing?

I think that I'll leave the Repo open, but since this is mostly gonna just be my own thougts, walkthroughs, and notes, I'm not sure why someone would really want to send a PR or Issue. :shrug:

## License

Not really sure what kind of license I'll put on here for now.  I know there are some good FSF licenses for documentation, I'll probably go for something like that.  (and I guess I'll write a post about it when I do the research)
