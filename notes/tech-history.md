# tech history

history is taught so we learn the mistakes of the past

old academics used to be in a network, involved in each other's research,
published papers, read each other's papers,

Dawn of the internet

Tech is moving unbelievably fast

YET I feel like people are reinventing the wheel a lot

## knowledge

We need more tech history class.

> Who's responsibility is it to be knowledgeable about the past? existing
> technologies, solutions, common pitfalls?

Developers in the workplace are typically just told what to do...

> So Tech Leads? Architects? Project managers? Management? CEO's/Visionaries
> themselves?

## discovery

It's a discovery problem now.

That's why google was so successful, they let people FIND web pages and content
on the internet.

But on the cutting edge you don't know what you don't know.

You can't search for things on the bleeding edge because you don't even know it
exists.

## academia

> How do we convince professors to parse, dredge, through mountains of internet
> data, just to keep up with what's new??? Do they need to? How do professors
> and academics currently keep up with industry trends, research, etc.? Is it
> just my personal bias that professors are behind because my undergraduate
> classes teach old materials?

> Where is research being done now? FAANG?
