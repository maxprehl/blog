# Windows and git, a fantastic history

It all began when I tried to configure GitBash. But what exactly **is** GitBash?
Another terminal emulator? The git source control tool for windows? An entire
development environment?! This is where my story begins.

## MinTTY

To configure my _terminal emulator_ settings, I opened the "options" panel of
GitBash.

"mintty 3.4.0 is available!"

### mintty.github.io

MinTTY is merely the default terminal emulator for the following applications:

-   Cygwin
-   MSYS
-   MSYS2

Based on PuTTY 0.60

## MinGW

The Minimal Gnu system for Windows

MSYS could be thought of as a minimal version of Cygwin.

### mingw.org/node/30

Interix,

known as Microsoft's **SFU**, Services for Unix, and now it is called **SUA**, a
Subsystem for Unix Application. Similar to **Cygwin**, It is a full-featured
UNIX/POSIX subsystem that runs on the top of the Microsoft Windows NT-based
operating systems.

### wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Interix

This is part of the original 3 pronged kernel that Microsoft had designed for
NT, with compatibility with win32, POSIX, and OS/2.

Found out this site is actually related to a programming language called
**tcl**.

I ended up following one of the main guys on twitter
([Donal Fellows](twitter.com/donalfellows)), but the other guy,
[Larry W. Virden](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Larry+Virden) aka LV aka
lvirden, seems to have his twitter hacked by botspam.

### [Who is using MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/docs/who-is-using-msys2/)

And so it seems we've come full circle... **Git for Windows** is based on MSYS2,
which uses **mintty** as it's terminal emulator. But what is this "Git for
Windows"? That's not the same _name_ as GitBash...
