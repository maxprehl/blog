# My Best Self

I recently watched a very smart man talk shop for 45 minutes straight to a bunch of college students.

He took questions at the end about the content and answered them to the best of his ability.

Then, he took the remaining time and talked to the kids about who he is as a person, 
and how he stumbled through life to become the respected individual that he is today.

He filled an entire slide with his ideals, motivations, and general wisdom of "What worked well" for him.

That got me thinking about who I am as a person.

Right now I'm in the part of my life where I'm going to be putting myself on display to companies 
(and maybe more schools) through interviews and job applications, 
so I want to try to do some soul searching and figure out my personal character,
and if I'm really being the best version of me.

## Small Communications Notes

* Build rapport/trust by showing vulnerability
* Be genuinely interested in what other people are doing
* Get feedback. Don't think "I'm the smartest person in the room"
* Tell a supporting story or anecdote, people remember them.
* Give a demo.  Get to "wow" quickly.
