# Apple



Reminds me of the IE antitrust lawsuit. 

The simplest example is the flashlight. 
If Apple took the flashlight app's spec, 
but implemented it in areas/APIS that apps "can't use," 
was it really fair? 

Should Tile sue Apple to argue that FindMy need not be bundled with the OS? 

Any component "integrated" in the OS is still just software... 
Apple just puts hard lines on 
"you can't get on the app store if you try to touch this/do that/etc."
It's just that the lines of what "apps" can do   

Seems like Apple has gotten really comfy with gimping third party software via App Store policies, 
thus allowing the "deep integration" of first party software...

I feel like there's a bit of flawed jump in logic at [7:20](https://youtu.be/qNAo0UdYF6g?t=440) regarding f.lux.  "Got kicked off the app store because they can't use private APIs" -> "ok seems reasonable because... Apple wants their devices to look the same?"  Was that defending the private API thing?  

From my perspective software is still just software. It might seem from a casual user that things like nightshift and findmy are "baked in" to the OS.  But are those features are so advanced that only Apple engineers could write the code for them?  Or is this just Apple's way of damning any 3rd party developers from EVER being able to compete with their copycat implementation.
